    “He doesn’t know what he doesn’t know.” <br>
    <p>II.</p>
    My friend told me this. He was very drunk, as was I.
    He was smoking a Cowboy Killer, the bright tip of the cigarette illuminating
    his slapdash manicure, patches of thick corrugated black contrasting his exposed, pinkish-white figernails. 
    His voice did not lilt nor undulate, just decayed into a fried whisper.
    I wondered for a moment if I loved this friend of mine, and I decided I did not. But, I did love the way he smoked. 
    I like being around smokers. They smell like ritual.

 III.I have an image in my mind of my grandfather and father sitting on a couch in Hangzhou. They do not speak, the TV droning with a made-for-television film that neither of them are watching. My father is reading a Kung-Fu novel and my grandfather is chain-smoking cigarettes, lighting the next cigarette in the queue with the current one. I do not remember my grandfather’s voice. He must have spoken to me, between the games of mahjong and cigarette puffing, but I do not remember a single word nor sound. Just the image of cigarettes, a couch, and a television.IV.I wrote a poem in the margins of a composition notebook:“He loved him, buthe didn’t know what he didn’t know, which was thathe was very sad”.I have since lost the notebook, meaning that the line breaks here were made arbitrarily. Which is fine by me—I have always felt uncomfortable navigating the physical space of a page. Too big, too small. I wrote it because I thought it was what my friend meant to say that night.V.He meant to say it in the following ways:“A loved B, but A didn’t know what A didn’t know, which was that B was very sad.”“A loved B, but A didn’t know what B didn’t know, which was that B was very sad”“A loved B, but B didn’t know what B didn’t know, which was that A was very sad”.“B loved A, but B didn’t know what B didn’t know, which was that A was very sad”“B loved B, but B didn’t know what B didn’t know, which was that B was very sad”…and all of the relevant permutations that can be assumed based on the rules implicitly established above.Which is to say that the smell of cigarettes, with its tar and formaldehyde, is strangely sweet.VI.My grandfather was imprisoned by the Red Guards when my father was ten or eleven. My father was asked to testify against him, but refused. Whenever I am shamed rightfully, and I have yet to be shamed wrongfully, I catalog the hand of my accuser, watching the micro-vibrations of their muscles, white bone pressing against cross-hatched skin.VII.Who is “he”? He=>(...) loved him=> (he=>(...) loved him but he=>(what he=>(but he=> (he=>(...) was very sad)))).VIII.My father loved my grandfather. I tell my friend. He cries. How hateful.Author Questions (Feel free to ignore the questions in your response, these are just some questions I had while writing the piece): How does the physical space of the text contribute/detract from the content of the piece? Does the piece feel complete?
